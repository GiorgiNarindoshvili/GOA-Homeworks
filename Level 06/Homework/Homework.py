#Task 1

#Let's Make A First Value using by input snake_case, and case-sensitive

Num_1=int(input("Enter First Number"))

#Let's make a second value using by input snake_case, and case-sensitive

Num_2=int(input("Enter Second Number"))

#Let make Third Value using by ressaign, snake_case and input

Num_2=int(input("Enter Third Number"))

## we are gonna do every mathematical operation what we know

# we are going to make a assembly

print(Num_1+Num_2)

#we are going to make multiplication

print(Num_1*Num_2)

#we are going to make division

print(Num_1/Num_2)

#we are going to make deducation

print(Num_1-Num_2)

#Task 2

#we're gonna make an customer account

#make a name using by Case-sensitive and input and snake_case

Customer_name=input("Enter the name of customer")

#make a last name using by Case-Sensitive and input and snake_case

Customer_lastname=input("Enter the last name of customer ")

#make a age using by Case-sensitive and input and snake_case

Customer_age=input("The Age of customer")

#make a password using by Case-sensitive and input and snake_case

Customer_password=input("The Password Of Customer")

#let's put info in terminal 

#Task 3

#Let's make same task but in f string

#Make name using by f string, snake_case and case-sensitive

Customer_name=("Giorgi")

#print customer name

print(f"Customer name is {Customer_name}")

#Make name using by f string, snake_case and case-sensitive

Customer_lastname=("Narindoshvili")

print(f"Customer Last Name Is {Customer_lastname}")

#make age of customer using by Case-sensitive, snake_case and f string

Customer_age=("15")

#print customer age

print(f"customer age is {Customer_age}")

#make a password of customer using by f string, snake_case and case-sensitive

Customer_password=("giorgi204294864")

#print customer password

print(f"Customer password is {Customer_password}")
