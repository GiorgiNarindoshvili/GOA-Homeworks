Notably, its standout feature is the Super Handling All-Wheel Drive system, intelligently distributing torque between all four wheels to enhance cornering abilities and deliver impressive road grip.

        <p><strong>Toyota Supra-Coming in at No. 1 is the world’s first production model of the 2020 Toyota Supra GR signed by Toyota chief executive Akio Toyoda. It sold for a whopping $2.1 million at Barrett-Jackson’s annual auction in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2019. Note, however, that the car was sold to benefit a charity; the entire bid amount went to the American Heart Association and the Bob Woodruff Foundation. Nonetheless, it was a thrilling moment at Barrett-Jackson as bids came in at $100,000 increments faster than a blink of an eye until reaching the final bid of $2.1 million. Aside from it being the first production model of 2020, it was painted in matte-gray over a red interior with red mirror caps and matte-black wheels, making it a true one of a kind.</strong></p>

Power is channeled to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission.Design-wise, the RC F looks like it's been chiseled by a futuristic sculptor who's also a bit of a rebel. The interior is no slouch either, getting into the seats is like getting a big, comfortable hug from a posh cloud. The designers really went all out with top-notch leather-trimmed seats and plush surfaces that make you feel like you're floating on a magic carpet of opulence.</strong></p>
