        <p><strong>Mercedes Maybach-When thinking about luxury cars, a brand that will never fail to spring to mind is Maybach. Originally an independent luxury company separate from Mercedes, Maybach became a sub-brand of Mercedes in 2015, allowing the company to continue to produce the best luxury cars on the market. One of the newer models created when Maybach was still independent in 2003 is the iconic Maybach 57, a car which, along with the Maybach 52 set the standard for luxury automobiles around the world in the early 2000s. The Mercedes S-Class range was already a great car, but the increased size, opulence, and performance took it to a whole new level.</p></strong>
