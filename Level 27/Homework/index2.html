        <p><strong>Ford Mustang-Entering its seventh generation in 2024 is the Ford Mustang, a legendary American sports car that has captured the hearts of enthusiasts for decades. With a rich heritage and iconic design, the Mustang has been the best-selling sports car in America for more than ten years, a testament to its enduring appeal and performance. At the top of the all-new range is the Dark Horse, a formidable powerhouse that not only embodies the legacy of the Mustang, but also sets a new standard for raw power and performance on the road. Under the hood of the 2024 Mustang Dark Horse is a potent 5.0-liter naturally aspirated V-8, which marks the beginning of a new era for the long-standing Coyote engine. Producing 500 horsepower and 418 pound-feet of torque, the Dark Horse comes as one of the most powerful sports cars on the market. The top-spec trim also comes with a six-speed manual transmission as standard, being one of the last sports/muscle cars to feature a manual in 2024.</p></strong>

        <p><strong>Chevrolet Camaro ZL1-Despite being discontinued after 2024, the Chevrolet Camaro remains one of the best modern muscle cars on the market. With the option to choose from seven trims, the Chevrolet Camaro offers a diverse range of driving experiences to cater to different preferences. However, the performance-focused ZL1 stands out as the pinnacle of the lineup, delivering exhilarating speed and power with its 6.2-liter supercharged V-8 engine.The 2024 Camaro starts at $72,100 for the top-spec ZL1. This makes the Camaro considerably more expensive than the Mustang Dark Horse, but that can be expected with the sizable increase in power. With Chevrolet committing to electric vehicles for the future, it's unlikely that we'll see another gas-powered replacement for the Camaro any time soon, making the 2024 ZL1 trim a fitting sendoff for one of the most iconic muscle cars of all time.The 2024 Camaro starts at $72,100 for the top-spec ZL1.

            <p><strong>Dodge Challenger-Another manufacturer that discontinued their flagship gas-powered muscle cars in 2024 is Dodge. With the all-new electric Charger set to replace the current Charger and Challenger, a gas-powered version will still be released in 2025 featuring a new inline-six engine. As for the outgoing two-door muscle car, the 2024 Dodge Challenger offers the pinnacle of muscle car prowess, especially with the top-spec SRT Super Stock. Producing a mighty 807 horsepower and 707 pound-feet of torque, the Super Stock is built for the best straight-line performance possible thanks to its 6.2-liter HEMI V-8.Costing just $5 more than the Hellcat Redeye Widebody Jailbreak trim, the SRT Super Stock is the most expensive 2023 Dodge Challenger you can buy. While both models look almost identical, the Widebody Jailbreak isn't as drag-focused, despite producing 797 horsepower itself. The Challenger Super Stock is not only the most powerful two-door muscle car in 2024, it's also the most expensive.</strong></p>
